For example : [Output]prediction[/Output].\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    \n    return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))\n### Response:\nThe function `sort_array` sorts the input array `arr` first by its natural order, and then by the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number.\n\nIn Python, the `sorted` function sorts an iterable and returns a new sorted list from the elements of the iterable. If the iterable is not already a list, it is first converted to a list.\n\nThe `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes one argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. In this case, the key is a function that returns the number of '1's in the binary representation of each number.\n\nThe `bin` function converts an integer number to a binary string, and the `[2:]` slice removes the '0b' prefix of the binary string. The `count('1')` method counts the number of '1's in the binary string.\n\nSo, if the input is [1,5,2,3,4], the function first sorts the numbers by their natural order, which gives [1,2,3,4,5]. Then it sorts the numbers by the number of '1's in their binary representation. The binary representation of 1 is '1', the binary representation of 2 is '10', the binary representation of 3 is '11', the binary representation of 4 is '100', and the binary representation of 5 is '101'. The number of '1's in these binary representations are 1, 1, 2, 1, and 2 respectively. So the sorted list by the number of '1's in the binary representation is [1,2,4,3,5].\n\nSo, the output of the function for the input [1,5,2,3,4] is [1,2,4,3,5]. So the prediction is [Output][1,2,4,3,5][/Output].\n", "is_correct": false}
